# Water Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict water quality using machine learning classification algorithms. The goal is to classify water samples into different quality categories based on various features such as pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen levels, and so on.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about water samples collected from various sources, along with their corresponding quality labels. It includes features such as pH, temperature, turbidity, conductivity, and more.

## Algorithms Used
1. **Logistic Regression**: Logistic regression is a simple yet effective classification algorithm that models the probability of an event occurring.

2. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: SVM is a powerful classification algorithm that finds the hyperplane that best separates data points of different classes in a high-dimensional space.

3. **Random Forests**: Random forests are an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes for classification.

4. **Naive Bayes**: Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with the "naive" assumption of feature independence.

5. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of learning long-term dependencies and is well-suited for sequential data such as time-series.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, scaling features if necessary, and encoding categorical variables.

2. **Feature Selection**: Identify relevant features that contribute most to the prediction task to improve model performance.

3. **Model Training**: Train each classification algorithm using the preprocessed data and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Compare the performance of different algorithms and select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

5. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the selected model for real-time prediction of water quality or integrate it into existing systems for monitoring and analysis.

## Conclusion
Through this project, we aim to develop an accurate and reliable water quality prediction system using machine learning classification algorithms. By leveraging the power of data-driven approaches, we can improve water quality monitoring and management, leading to better decision-making and resource allocation.
